# Normalized Least Mean Squares (NLMS) and Least Mean Squares (LMS) adaptive filters

This repository represents the implementation of a Normalized Least Mean Squares (NLMS) and a Least Mean Squares (LMS) adaptive filters. 
To show the effectiveness of the filters, we generated an artificial signal, and we added gaussian noise. 


The input signal is represented in the first subplot, the desired signal in the second subplot and the filtered signal using LMS is represented in the third subplot:

For NLMS, the coefficients of the filter are represented in the first subplot, and their corresponding Fourier Transform in the second subplot. The error estimation is represented in the third subplot.

The frequency domain representations of the added noise, desired signal, input signal and the filtered signal are represented below.
